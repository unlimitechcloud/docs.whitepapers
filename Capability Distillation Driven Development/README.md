## The Problem

Organizations are pouring resources into AI initiatives driven by competitive pressure—yet 80% of projects fail, half are abandoned after proof of concept, and only 39% report any real business impact. The root cause isn't the technology. It's that we're applying traditional development methodologies to a fundamentally different problem: one where uncertainty is the starting condition, not an obstacle to be planned away.

*CDDD / C3D* offers a way out. A framework that accepts uncertainty as the norm, allows capabilities to be progressively distilled, and ensures investment follows evidence—not assumptions.
