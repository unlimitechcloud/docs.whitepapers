## Abstract

The term "AI-First" has become ubiquitous in software development discourse, yet lacks a formal, rigorous definition. Existing definitions tend to be aspirational rather than operational—they describe a desired state without providing criteria for determining whether something is or is not AI-First. This whitepaper addresses this gap by establishing a formal definition grounded in a clear criterion: **who produces the artifacts of a process**.
